The binary search algorithm. What is it?
This algorithm consists of taking a sorted list and a value whose index needs to be found, and returns this index.
How it works:
We set the lower and upper bounds of the list, and at each iteration, depending on whether the desired value is greater or less than the middle, we change these bounds.
The number of actions is log2N, where N is the length of the array
